# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project is currently in early-stage development. Security fixes are applied to the latest branch state.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, please do not open a public issue first.

Please report privately with:

- A clear description of the issue and impact
- Reproduction steps or proof of concept
- Affected files and configuration
- Suggested mitigation if available

Until a dedicated private channel is configured, open a minimal issue that requests a private contact route without disclosing exploit details.

## Security Baseline

Operational security guidance and default controls are documented in `docs/security.md`.
